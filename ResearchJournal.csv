left,Zach Blas,1,"Zach Blas (West Virginia, USA) is an artist, filmmaker, and writer whose practice spans moving image, computation, theory, performance, and science fiction. Blas engages the materiality of digital technologies while also drawing out the philosophies and imaginaries lurking in artificial intelligence. The work on the left is is an immersive moving image installation that explores the religious unconscious of artificial intelligence emotion recognition. It features 10 channels of video and a 5.1 surround-sound design, incorporating machine-learning generated material related to religious weeping. Two towering steel sculptures hold screens secured between spikes that display computer graphics animations of crying eyes, evoking weeping religious statues, professional mourners, and medical test subjects.

left,Hans Haacke,2,"Haacke is best known as a pioneer of institutional critique. Many of his works attempt to expose the connections between money, politics, and art. Haacke’s 1967 solo exhibition at the Hayden Gallery included works he called “systems,” produced with the “explicit intention of having their components physically communicate with each other, and the whole communicate physically with the environment.” Something I find particularly interesting about Haacke's work is that he works collaboratively with Javascript, databases, open source GIS tools and image editing programs.

This immersive project combines audio and visual elements to prompt the viewer to disconnect from the construct of time. It mirrors the sounds of what we can decifer as a landscape to enforce a meditative ryhthm and lull the listener.

left,Iris,4,"This is an interactive installation by Haybe Studio that utilises a large monochrome LCD canvas to track viewer's body movement. It uses the passage of ambient light, not emission of light itself. The canvas is hooked up to a Kinect so users can see their movements reflected in real time. I love how something so simple as bodily movement is transformed here into digital artwork and scenery.

left,Sebastian Schmieg,5,"""When it all started"" is a text about art and the NFT landscape, consisting of 16 short fragments. Each of these fragments is also an NFT: a generative, animated website made up of the letters of the text fragment. I was really intrifued by this artwork by the in which it employs various NFTs into a highly ineractive design. This led me to explore Schmieg's other work and practises. Particularly, Schmieg focuses on labor, algorithmic management, and artificial intelligence. He works in a wide range of media including video, website, installation, artist book, custom software, lecture performance, and delivery service. The majority of his work is a direct commentary on the algorithmic circulation of images, texts, and bodies.

left,Grid Spreading ,6,"The work pictured here is by a student named Naoki Tsutae that I discovered on a Processing library. The student has a wide array of interactive sketches on display. I liked this sketch in particular due to its high level of intricacy and atttention to detail. The dynamic algorithm is almost hypnotising. The smoothness of the interface encourages the viewer to play and interact whilst also prompting a curiosity to understand it's inner workings.

The themes of the transformation can be customised and they change every few seconds so that participants get a chance to play with many alter-egos. Random Quark says to achieve real-time rending they ""built a custom pipeline that uses multiple RTX4090 GPU cards in parallel that receive frames from the client and respond with frames rendered by Stable Diffusion.""

left,Eno Henze,10,"Eno Henze is an artist, scenographer and designer based in Germany. Specialising in installation and stage design, his works examine how machines transform aesthetic reasoning and notions of the human. I was drawn to Henze when I disovered a gallery of his creative coding artwork (see left) that use algorithms to develop extraordinary shape and form. The works are so intricate that it evidently blurs the line between reality and digitality.
